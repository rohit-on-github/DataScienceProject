# Titanic 

This is the legendary Titanic ML project â€“ the best.

Using machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

## Goal
Job is to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not.
For each in the test set, predict a 0 or 1 value for the variable.

## Metric
The score is the percentage of passengers correctly predicted. This is known as accuracy.

## Steps followed in the project

### Data Collection

Data is downloaded from the kaggle platform where it is presented as competition

### Exploratory Data Analysis

Variables are identified for being predictor and target. Their Dataypes are identified. Categorical and Numerical Data are identified. 

#### Univariate Analysis 
By plotting histograms, bar chart and boxplot.

#### Data Cleansing 
Missing value chart. No null values found, outliers were removed.

#### Bivariate Analysis 
By plotting scatter plots and bar plots.

### Feature Engineering

Categorical Values Label Encoded
Continuous values standardized
One Hot encoding the Categorical Values

### Splitting Dataset

### Model Building
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Classification
Stochastic Gradient
K nearest neighbours
Gaussian Process
Gaussian Naive Bayes
Decision Tree

### Prediction and Score
Using Accuracy
K nearest neighbors have best accuracy

### Deployment
Pickle file created from model for deployment
