Learn computer vision fundamentals with the famous MNIST data

MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.


## Goal

The goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images. Curated a set of tutorial-style kernels which cover everything from regression to neural networks. Experimented with different algorithms to learn first-hand what works well and how techniques compare.

## Metric
The score is the percentage of digits correctly predicted. This is known as accuracy.

## Steps followed in the project

### Data Collection

Data is downloaded from the kaggle platform where it is presented as competition

### Exploratory Data Analysis

Columns are identified for being label and pixels. T

#### Data Cleansing 
Missing value chart. No null values found.

### PCA
More than 700 columns were analysed for 10 principal components

### Model Building
Logistic Regression
SVM
K nearest neighbors
Gaussian Naive Bayes
Perceptron
LinearSVC
Stochastic Gradient
Decision Tree
Random Forest

### Prediction and Score
Using Accuracy
Random Forest have best accuracy
